The ViT-IR-implement repository provides a complete implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) models for image retrieval tasks. It implements the approach described in the paper "Vision Transformer for Image Retrieval" (<https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2101.03771>) with several optimizations. This system extracts image features using pre-trained ViT models, normalizes these features using various methods, and calculates image similarity using different distance metrics to retrieve similar images.

For information about setting up the system, see a generated AI documention in [Delvin](https://deepwiki.com/ithaquaKr/ViT-IR-implement)
